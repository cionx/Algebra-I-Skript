Notes for _Algebra I_, SS 14
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cionx/algebra-1-notes-ss-14.svg?branch=master)][1]
=================

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course _Algebra I_, which was held at the University of Bonn in the summer semester of 2014 by Prof. Dr. Catharina Stroppel.
An up to date compiled version can be found [here][2].

Some things to look out for:

- Iâ€™m still changing things from time to time, which can lead to changes in numbering.

  There is currently no system in place to download older versions.

- For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

  - Compiling is intented to be done using `xelatex`.
  - The bibliography is using `biber`.
  - The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.

  The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][3] and may not (but should) work on other machines.

For comments and corrections please contact me at `stelzner (at) uni-bonn.de`.
