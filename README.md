Notes for _Algebra I_, SS 14
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cionx/algebra-1-notes-ss-14.svg?branch=master)][1]
=================

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course _Algebra I_, which was held at the University of Bonn in the summer semester of 2014 by Prof. Dr. Catharina Stroppel.

These notes are currently being reworked.
An up to date compiled version can be found [here][2].

---

For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

- Compiling is intented to be done using `xelatex`.
- The bibliography is using `biber`.
- The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.

The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][3] and may not (but should) work on other machines.
