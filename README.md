Notes for _Algebra I_, SS 14
=================

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course _Algebra I_, which was given by Prof. Dr. Catharina Stroppel at the University of Bonn in the summer semester of 2014.
An up to date compiled version can be found [HERE][1].

Some things to look out for:

- Iâ€™m still changing things from time to time, which can lead to changes in numbering.

- There is currently no system in place to download older versions.

- For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

  - Compiling is intented to bo done with `latexmk`, or by hand via `xelatex`.
  - The bibliography is using `biber` and `biblatex`.
  - The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit on the title page. (The project will still compile without this package, but the compiled result will be missing the git metadata on the title page.)

For comments and corrections please contact me at `jendrikstelzner (at) uni-bonn.de`.
