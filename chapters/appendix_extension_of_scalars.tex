\chapter{Extension of Scalars}
\label{appendix: extension of scalars}


\begin{conventions}
  During this appendix we fix a field extension $L/k$.
\end{conventions}


\begin{fluff}
  Every $L$-vector space $W$ can be regarded as a $k$-vector space in a straightforward way, and this process is known as the \emph{restriction of scalars}.
  Less straightforward but often useful is the reverse process, the \emph{extension of scalars}, which extends every $k$-vector space $V$ to an $L$-vector spaces $V_L$.
  
  In this section we give a short introduction to this process.
  We assume that the reader is familiar with the tensor product of vector spaces.
