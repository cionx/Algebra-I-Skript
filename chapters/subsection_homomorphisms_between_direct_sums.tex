\subsection{Homomorphims Between Direct Sums}


\begin{conventions}
  We denote by $R$ a ring.
\end{conventions}


\begin{fluff}
  In this section we will explain how $R$-module homomorphisms between finite direct sums can be represented  by matrices.
  We keep our treatment elementary and will not (explicitely) use the categorical notions of coproducts, products or biproducts.
  We introduce the reader who is familiar with these notions to generalize the following content to an arbtiray abelian category.
