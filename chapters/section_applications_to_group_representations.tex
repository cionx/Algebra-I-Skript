\section{Applications to Group Representations}


\begin{fluff}
  We will now apply our previous results to the representation theory of groups and also enhance some our previous results.
  In the following we will not distinguish between representations of a groups $G$ over a field $k$ and $k[G]$-modules, unless necessary.
\end{fluff}


\begin{conventions}
  In the following, $k$ denotes a field and $G, H$ denote groups and $V$ denotes a representation of $G$ over $k$.
  We abbreviate $\dim_k \defines \dim$ and $\tensor_k \defined \tensor$.
\end{conventions}
