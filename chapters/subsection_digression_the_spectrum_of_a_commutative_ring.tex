% \subsection{Digression: The Spectrum of a Commutative Ring}

% Idea:
% Use k[X_1, \dotsc, X_n] to motivate maxspec.
% Introduce sobrification to examime the space irreducible subspaces
% Show that for k[X_1, \dotsc, X_n] sobrification of Maxspec corresponds to Spec
% introduce spec for arbitrary commutative rings
% show that Zariski topology is indeed a topology
% show usual properties for vanishing sets
% explain that R are functions on X
% explain that geometric intuition works for Jacobson rings
% example: show that things work for k[X_1, \dotsc, X_n] with k not algebraically closed
% example: MaxSpec(R[X]) is bigger than just R
% irreducible subsets of Spec(R) correspond to prime ideals in R

% the problem that REFERENCE fails for the maximal ideal (X^2 + 1) is that there is not point a \in R corresponding to this maximal ideal
