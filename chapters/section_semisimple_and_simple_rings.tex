\section{Semisimple and Simple Rings}


\begin{fluff}
  In this section we introduce and classify semisimple rings.
\end{fluff}


\begin{conventions}
  In this section $R$ denotes a ring.
\end{conventions}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma: center of matrix ring}
  For every $n \geq 0$ the map
  \[
            \ringcenter(R)
    \to     \ringcenter(\Mat_n(R))  \,,
    \quad   z
    \mapsto z I_n
  \]
  is an isomorphism of rings.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
  The given map is a well-defined injective ring homomorphism and we need to show that it is surjective, i.e.\ that every $A \in \ringcenter(\Mat_n(R))$ is of the form $A = z I_n$ for some $z \in \ringcenter(R)$.
  
  We have for all $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ that
  \[
      \text{$i$-th column of $A$}
    = A e_i
    = A E_{ii} e_i
    = E_{ii} A e_i
    = \vect{ 0 & \cdots & 0 & a_{ii} & 0 & \cdots & 0}^T \,,
  \]
  which shows that $A$ is a diagonal matrix.
  We have for all $i,j = 1, \dotsc, n$ that
  \[
      A_{ii} E_{ij}
    = A E_{ij}
    = E_{ij} A
    = A_{jj} E_{ij}
  \]
  and therefore $A_{ii} = A_{jj}$.
  This shows that $A$ is a scalar matrix, i.e.\ that $A = zI_n$ for some $z \in R$.
  We have for every $r \in R$ that
  \[
      (rz) I_n
    = (r I_n) (z I_n)
    = (r I_n) A
    = A (r I_n)
    = (z I_n) (r I_n)
    = (z I_n) I_n \,,
  \]
  which shows that $rz = zr$ for every $r \in R$ and therefore that $z \in \ringcenter(R)$.
\end{proof}
