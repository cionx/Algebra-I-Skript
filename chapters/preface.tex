\chapter*{Preface}

The following text are my personal notes for the lecture \emph{Algebra I}, which was given by Prof.\ Dr.\ Catharina Stroppel at the University of Bonn during the summer semester of 2014.
These notes were initially created to provide me with a more readable version of my original handwritten notes, and to help me and some friend prepare for the upcoming exam.

Since then I have reworked these notes by adding things which I found useful for understanding the topics at hand and by adding various remarks.
I have done so in the hope of clarifying things and to give me an opportunity for introducing new errors and mistakes.
While the overall structure and choice of topics remains unchanged, the choice of exposition does at times not faithfully reflect the original lecture.
