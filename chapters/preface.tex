\chapter*{Preface}

These are my notes for the lecture \emph{Algebra I}, which was given by Prof.\ Dr.\ Catharina Stroppel at the University of Bonn during the summer of 2014.
These notes were created by the author in preparation for the upcoming exam and do at times not completely agree with the lecture, in particular when it comes to organization of the content and some of the proofs.
