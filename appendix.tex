\chapter{Extension of scalars}





\section{Definition}


Let $L/k$ be a field extension. For a $k$-vector space $V$ we define
\[
 V_L := L \otimes_k V.
\]
Then $V_L$ is a $L$-vector space via
\[
 \lambda \cdot (l \otimes v) = (\lambda l) \otimes v
\]
for all $\lambda \in L$. To see that this multiplication is well-defined notice that for every $\lambda \in L$ the multiplication with $\lambda$ in $L$, namely
\[
 \pi_\lambda : L \to L, l \mapsto \lambda l,
\]
is $L$-linear and thus $k$-linear. The multiplication with $\lambda \in L$ as defined above is simply given by $\pi_\lambda \otimes \id_V$.
